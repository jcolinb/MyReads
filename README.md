##To use the app

Books in your library are displayed on one of three shelves: books you want to read, are currently reading, or books you've finished.

The button at the bottom left of the page will let you search for new books to add to your shelves.

To add a book to a shelf, use the menu on the bottom left of the book to select which shelf to add it to. You can switch shelves of books already in your library too!
